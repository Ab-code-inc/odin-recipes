# odin-recipes
My first Odin Assignment.

This my first odin assignment.
Loved working on my first actual website.
Added a few extras as compared to the instructions.
Learned the extra features from the additional resources given by odin at the end of every lesson.
Hopefully this is just a start and one day I would be able to make a meaning full contribution to the beautiful world of coding.
